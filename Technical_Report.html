<p>
I tried the new html tag "mark", it highlights the words inside of it.
My page looked similar across the diffirent browsers I tested those<br>
included Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Also,
across desktop and phone the wesbite looked the same but was hard to<br>
read since the text and all images were scaled down to fit on the phone.
I spent around 4 hours on this lab mostly spent on figuring out how to<br>
host the files on a server and finding and implementing a password 
protection method. It is a java script that consists of a while loop that asks for the correct password of 12345 in order for it to redirect you to main_page.html, if wrong password entered it prompts you to enter correct password.
